Hello! I am a doctoral student in the [Trapped Ion Quantum Information Group](https://tiqi.ethz.ch) under the supervision of [Jonathan Home](https://www.phys.ethz.ch/the-department/people/person-detail.MTczOTE1.TGlzdC81MTUsMTE3MjU5OTI5OQ==.html). 

I graduated in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Imperial College London and did my thesis at the Photonics Laboratory of ETH Zürich.
Before joining TIQI, I worked on control systems for high power converters (CERN) and unmanned aerial vehicles (Milan Polytechnic). I then moved to quantum optics, working with NV- centres in diamond for hybrid quantum systems.
Here at TIQI, I am working on long ion chains for quantum error correction.
