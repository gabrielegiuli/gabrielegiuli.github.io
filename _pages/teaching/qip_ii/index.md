## Quantum Optics Notes

Here are some notes I co-written with [Yuto Motohashi](https://yutomotohashi.github.io) and [Lukas Kostal](https://www.kostallukas.com/). You might find them useful to dig deeper into some derivations that we encoutner in the classes. Note that they are still a work in progress.
