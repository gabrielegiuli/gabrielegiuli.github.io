  <strong>Note:</strong> when first making this material, I did not intend to release it. Its original purpose was to assist me during my TAs. As a result, you might find the notes to be rough around the edges and including some mistakes. Any feedback is more than welcome!

### Quantum Information Processing II: Implementations
*Fall 2025, Master's degree programme in Physics*  

A continuation of the Quantum Information Processing I, this course explores how the principles of quantum computing are realized in physical systems — from superconducting qubits to trapped ions and photonic platforms. We also discuss error correction, decoherence, and scalable architectures.
