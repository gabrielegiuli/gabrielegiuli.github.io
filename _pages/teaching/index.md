### Quantum Information Processing II: Implementations
*Fall 2025, Master's degree programme in Physics*  

A continuation of the Quantum Information Processing sequence, this course explores how the principles of quantum computing are realized in physical systems — from superconducting qubits to trapped ions and photonic platforms. We also discuss error correction, decoherence, and scalable architectures.
